Important Concepts:

* Terrain
    * Volcano
    * Terrain1
    * Terrain2
    * Terrain3
    * Terrain4
* Tile
* Game board
* Placing a tile
* Location of tiles
* Playing Piece
    * Meeple
    * Totoro
* Placing a playing piece
* Collections of pieces (settlements)
* Location of pieces


Implementation Order

Basically the order of enumeration.
The first thing that needs to be implemented is the pieces, and a way of representing the “game board.”

Terrain: Need to decided whether a terrain will be a class, or if it will simply be represented by a string.

Tile: A tile will contain information about itself, and game data, such as whether it is still a valid tile (it hasn’t been covered by another tile — if it has been covered, a pointer to the tile that covered it?), if there are any pieces (Meeple or Totoro) on any of its terrains… Maybe pointers to its adjacent tiles?

Game board: Maybe not a game board itself (since there isn’t an actual game board in this game), but a way of representing the current pieces placed on the table.

Placing a tile: Updating the “game board” data structure with the information that a new tile has been added.

Location of tiles: Where is a tile location with respect to a reference point… Maybe with respect to the first tile that was placed?

Playing piece: Maybe a class, maybe a simple count that lives on a tile/terrain class, but a simple way of representing that a piece has been placed down.

Placing a playing piece: 
Updating whatever data structure, count, or whatever it is that keeps track of the pieces placed on a tile/terrain, and a way to distinguish between it being a Maple or a Totoro.

Collection of pieces (settlements): Keeping track of the settlements — a quick way of addressing a settlement to update its status.

Location of pieces: Keeping track of individual pieces rather than settlements, maybe?


Acceptance Tests

Scenario: Placing a tile

Given it is my turn
And I have a tile
And the game board is empty
Then I should place the tile down anywhere on level 1
And I should record the location of that tile on the game board

Given it is my turn
And I have a tile
And there are pieces already on the game board 
Then I should choose where to place the tile
And I should record the location of that tile on the game board

Given it is my turn 
And I have a tile
And I choose to place the tile on top of a level 1 tile
Then I should make sure that there are no Totoro on any of the terrains I will cover
And I should make sure I am not attempting to cover a level 1 settlement
And I should make sure the volcano of the tile I am attempting to place is on top of a volcano

Give it is my turn 
And I have a tile And I choose to place the tile on top of a level 2+ tile
Then I should make sure that there are no Totoro on any of the terrains I will cover
And I should make sure I am not attempting to cover a level 1 settlement
And I should make sure the volcano of the tile I am attempting to place is on top of a volcano
And I should make sure there are no empty spaces below any of the terrains of my tile

Scenario: Playing a piece

Given it is my turn
And I have already placed my tile down
And I have Meeple left
And I have decided to found a settlement
Then I should pick a terrain on level 1
And I should make sure the terrain is empty
And I should make sure the terrain is not a volcano And I should place a Meeple there by updating the game status

Given it is my turn 
And I have already placed my tile down
And I have Meeple left
And I have at least one settlement in place
And there are empty, non-volcanic terrains adjacent to the settlement
And I have decided to expand the settlement with a Meeple
Then I should and empty, non-volcanic terrain adjacent to the settlement
And I should place the Meeple there by updating the game status

Given it is my turn 
And I have already placed my tile down
And I have Totoro left
And I have at least one settlement in place of size five or more
And there are empty, non-volcanic terrains adjacent to the settlement 
And I have decided to place a Totoro down
Then I should pick an empty, non-volcanic terrain adjacent to the settlement
And I should place the Totoro there by updating the game status
