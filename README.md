# CEN3031---Class-Project
This is the final class project for CEN3031 at the University of Florida.

The idea is that this code implements a board game called TigerIsland&trade;. 

The code will have to interact with a server which will serve as the game arbiter, and there needs 
to be an ongoing interaction with the server thoughout the game.

Please refer to this repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/gaboth22/CEN3031---Class-Project/wiki) for coding standards.
